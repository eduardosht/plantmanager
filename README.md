**About Rocketseat Week (NLW 5)**
This project was developed during the [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/) week (NLW), it was designed to teach theory and practice about React Native.
After this week of programming, the study has to continue, so I decided to make improvements over this project, and made a roadmap of the improvements to be made, and others to be added to roadmap for the project.
The project is open to any type of collaboration, be it in the documentation, as in the development or ideas for the project.
The purpose of this repository is to show continuous study as a programmer, but also as a tool for anyone who wants to use it.
